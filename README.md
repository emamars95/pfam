# Project Title
## Overview
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classification tasks. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of provide a brief description of the dataset. The goal is to accurately classify the input data into different categories or classes.

Features
Utilizes the powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classification tasks.
Trains the CNN model on a labeled dataset to learn meaningful features and make accurate predictions.
Provides functionality to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Implements techniques such as data preprocessing, augmentation, and validation to enhance model performance.
Offers flexibility to customize the CNN architecture, including the number of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
Enables visualization of the model's architecture using the plot_model function.
Supports integration with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
Usage
To use the CNN model:

Install the required dependencies and libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.
Prepare your dataset by ensuring it is properly labeled and preprocessed.
Modify the CNN architecture and hyperparameters as needed in the provided code.
Train the CNN model on your dataset using the fit function, specifying the training data and validation data.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
Make predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.
